Oh My Zsh upgrades are handled by the $ZSH/tools/upgrade.sh script. To update any custom plugins (assuming those are Git clones), you can add these lines to the end of the script before the exit command:

printf "\n${BLUE}%s${RESET}\n" "Updating custom plugins"
cd custom/plugins

for plugin in */; do
  if [ -d "$plugin/.git" ]; then
     printf "${YELLOW}%s${RESET}\n" "${plugin%/}"
     git -C "$plugin" pull
  fi
done
